      <h6 id="info" class="flexText">Anisa Uddin is in highschool, and loves to try out all sorts of things! She is currently working on her own novel, starting up her own blog, working on her design/drawing skills, practicing dance, and learning how to code. When she has the free time, she's either holed up in her room reading or jamming out to music while brainstorming for future projects. She wishes that you have an amazing day. No matter what you're working at, you can do it as long as you stay productive! :)</h6>
