      <h6 id="info" class="flexText">The Productivity Place was orginally created by Anisa Uddin for a Stem League Hackathon Project. She chose this idea because she wanted to create a tool that could be used in everyday life. (Not to mention that the design is pretty cool, right? No more looking at those boring white boxes.) This site will be updated in the future, so all features are usuable but are subject to change.</h6>
